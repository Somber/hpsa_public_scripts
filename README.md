ITS - Public HPSA Scripts
=========================

A collection of some scripts I have made for HPSA (HP Server Automation)

## Development and Testing
Most of my development is done on a Windows server that is running the HPSA agent.
I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to work on my code.

In order to execute the scripts, you need to setup the following environment to bring the SA python binary into your path.

```
setlocal
set PATH=%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Opsware\agent\lcpython15;%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Opsware\agent\bin;%PATH%
set PYTHONPATH=%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Opsware\agent\pylibs
```

### Important Python Note
Python is a white-space sensitive language.
As such, you need to keep in mind the formatting.

Editing Python files in Notepad/Wordpad will not work most of the time.
You either need to use Sublime, or some other more advanced editor. Even VIM/Emacs works.

All python files I write are created with a tab equalling 4 spaces.

```python
# -*- mode: Python; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-
# ex: set tabstop=4 :
# Please do not change the two lines above. See PEP 8, PEP 263.
```

### Authentication
Authentication while running these scripts is done one of the following ways.

* Specify as options to the program. Using -u and -p
* Use the environment variables **SA_USER** and **SA_PWD**
* Inherit permissions from the Global Shell under which the user is running. 

Most scripts here use the following code to perform the authentication.
```python
if opts.username and opts.password:
    ts.authenticate(opts.username,opts.password)
elif os.environ.has_key('SA_USER') and os.environ.has_key('SA_PWD'):
    ts.authenticate(os.environ['SA_USER'],os.environ['SA_PWD'])
else:
    print "Username and Password not provided. Script may fail unless running in OGSH. \n Specify with -u username -p password"
```

## Running in Production
Most scripts are light-weight and can be run either from a SA-Managed Server or from the Global Shell. (Check the User Guide for details on the Global Shell)

However, the remediation script can take up 30+ minutes to run if you are targeting a large number of servers.

Ensure that the server you are running from has a solid network connection. Or if using the Global Shell, ensure that your VPN does not time out.

I make no claim for the effectiveness, safety, security or quality of the scripts contained within.
